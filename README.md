# CS2-Insights-Web

This project focuses on summarizing and sharing various tips and knowledge from Counter-Strike 2, primarily in the area of using different types of grenades, such as smoke or flash. The web application is built using the Quasar framework on the frontend, Adonis on the backend, and uses PostgreSQL as its database.

The main goal of this project is to function as a forum where players can post their tricks and useful guides. Other users can then save these tips to their own maps and utilize them as needed. Through this, we aim to make it easier for Counter-Strike 2 players to improve their skills and share valuable information that can help them in various in-game situations.
